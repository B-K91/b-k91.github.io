The organization of work through projects is a managerial choice that many companies are rapidly implementing, also in relation to the crisis of more traditional job division principles, which are mainly based on the technical specialization of individual workers and on the coordination mechanism between specialists.


Companies that operate on a commission basis, which develop and achieve the objectives of a project at the request of a client, have always had the ability to organize and manage projects. Their management techniques, methods, and tools have long been under observation by those companies that can be defined as more traditional from an organizational point of view and that offer products and services that are not tailor-made for customers following given directives, but are the same for all customers.


The increasing demand for personalized products and services according to new requests and needs from customers, combined with the progressive inefficiency of traditional methods of control and management of people, have led managers and entrepreneurs to ask themselves how to revitalize inefficient work contexts, often tired and unable to offer customers a satisfactory product and service.
In this case, the solution that appears to guarantee the best results in the short term is the introduction and diffusion of project organization.


A report by Economist Intelligence has shown that 80% of global executives believe that having project management as a key competence has helped them remain competitive during economic crises.


The commitment of the entire organization in project management leads to better results and long-term commercial value.
Normally, a project arises from an innovative idea that is proposed within the organization or from the detection of a problem with products and services or in one of the existing company processes. Once the problem to be contained has been identified, company figures come together and decide whether or not to start the project that will produce the expected result.


Project Management methodologies are used in the project's start-up phase and throughout its duration. Organizing, managing, and realizing a project means carrying out its processes and achieving a result. This result is then introduced into the life of the organization.


Project work favors innovation in the company. Process work, on the other hand, is normally characterized by the repeated execution of codified and standardized work of tasks with low or no innovation. By introducing an organizational form into repetitive work that leads people to seek innovation, this could lead to an improvement in existing processes.

Project Management can be defined as the application of processes, methods, competences, knowledge, and experience used to achieve specific project objectives according to given acceptance criteria and within agreed parameters.

The project management has final variables that are linked to a pre-established time and budget.
This methodology has allowed organizations to significantly improve their way of designing, introducing new concepts such as the project life cycle in the company, thanks to which it is possible to program activities and use resources based on pre-established time objectives; organizations clearly state the objectives to be achieved, the resources used, the costs, and the time required for their implementation. As we will see in more detail in the next chapters, Project Management plays a role of considerable importance, with the task of managing the project life cycle with the aim of achieving the expected results, using the various tools made available.

"At its most fundamental, Project Management is about people getting things done." - Dr. Martin Barnes, President APM 2003-2012.

A key factor that distinguishes Project Management from simple "management" is that its final variable has a finite time frame, unlike management which is a continuous process. For this reason, a Project Manager will need a wide range of skills, often hard skills, but mainly soft skills.


A survey conducted by the consulting giant McKinsey & Co. found that almost 60% of senior executives stated that establishing a strong discipline of Project Management is an absolute priority for their companies.

In the following articles, we will consider the role of the Project Manager, how a project is born and managed, the importance of stakeholders, project process groups, and risk management.

How it all started?
Many believe that Project Management is a relatively new work methodology, but it has actually been a practice used since ancient times. Consider the Egyptian pyramids, the Colosseum in Rome, or the Eiffel Tower in Paris. All of these great engineering works, and many others, were completed using Project Management techniques that were certainly different from those used in modern society, but with similarities that have remained unchanged despite thousands of years since the completion of the oldest projects to the more modern ones in engineering and beyond.


All of these past projects would have been impossible to complete without a culture and knowledge of project management. Times have changed, but the substance has remained the same, evolving as a result of technological innovations and cultural progress over the last centuries.


The modern concept of Project Management was initially introduced by the construction and industrial engineering sectors, and a fundamental contribution was made by the American engineer Henry Gantt, who is known for inventing a tool that allows the planning of tasks necessary for the completion of a project through a table that contains the phases, duration, and resources needed to complete the project. This tool is known as the Gantt chart and is used by a large percentage of Project Managers.


Organizational concepts of Project Management, as discussed earlier, have been used since ancient times, but this methodology has had a more marked growth and diffusion curve starting from the mid-twentieth century. In the 1950s, the concept of a project lifecycle was introduced, as well as planning and management control methods such as PERT, a design tool used to calculate the realistic amount of time required for a project.


With the growth achieved by innovation, Project Management has also undergone evolution at the same pace as large engineering companies during the 1960s, taking into account the Italian market. From this time on, the same Project Management systems and methodologies currently used were utilized.


It was in the 1980s that PM reached its full and concrete maturity, spreading in various sectors of industry and services, registering significant growth in practical application. In modern times, the need to build software products and innovative services has led to the spread of Agile methodologies, which will be discussed in the following blog posts.

Fundamental Elements
All projects are carried out within certain constraints, traditionally costs, time, and scope. These three factors (commonly referred to as 'the triple constraint') are represented as a triangle, as shown in Figure 1.1. Each constraint forms a vertex, with quality as the central theme:

Projects must be delivered within budget.
Projects must be delivered on time.
Projects must satisfy the agreed-upon scope.
Projects must also satisfy the customer's quality requirements.

The Triple Constraint states that a project's success is influenced by its budget, deadlines, and features.


The Project Manager can execute a trade-off between these three constraints; however, changing one constraint will have some impact on the other two.

Cost: The financial commitment of the project depends on various variables. There are the resources involved, from materials to people, which include labor costs. There are other external forces that can affect a project, which must be considered in the cost of work.

Time: Projects have a deadline for delivery. When the project's time is reduced, its cost will need to be increased or its scope reduced.

Quality: This element identifies everything needed to plan and produce an effective project that meets or exceeds stakeholders' quality objectives.The triple constraint represents the key elements of a project that, when balanced well, lead to success.

The Project Manager has the task of educating clients about the triple constraint of project management, creating the best balance, and being aware of all changes that will impact costs, time, and scope.
